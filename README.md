# Mallbot - Fine-tuned Mall Assistant Bot

A fine-tuned AI Mallbot - using OpenAI API, Netlify, and Google Cloud Functions. Developed "Mallbot" for store location assistance and general mall inquiries.

## Project Description

- Developed a custom mall assistant bot called "Mallbot" through the fine-tuning of a language model.
- Performed fine-tuning on a pre-trained model using proprietary data, resulting in a highly specialized and context-aware conversational AI system.
- Crafted responses tailored to user queries by training the model on a dataset stored in a structured JSONL format.
- Generated custom fine-tuned data, enhancing the bot's understanding and providing accurate and relevant responses to user inquiries.
- Improved the model's performance by optimizing hyperparameters, including the use of n_epochs to increase the response rate.
- Implemented a serverless function for secure retrieval of the OpenAI API key, ensuring efficient and secure communication with external services.

This project showcases my proficiency in natural language processing, data fine-tuning, and your ability to build practical AI solutions.
